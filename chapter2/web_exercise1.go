/**
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Exercise 1: Calling Methods
 * The strings package has a Builder type that is used to build a long text string out of multiple shorter strings.
 * A strings.Builder value has a variety of different methods you can call, but this exercise is going to focus on these three:
 * The WriteRune method accepts a rune as an argument and adds that rune onto the end of the string being built.
 * The WriteString method works just like WriteRune, except that it accepts a string as an argument.
 * The String method takes no arguments. Its return value is the accumulated string.
 * Complete the code sample below. The sample contains YOUR CODE HERE comments in the places you should add code, with a description of what your code should do.

	 // "builder" 3 times, once with the rune 'a', once
	 // with the rune 'b', and a third time with 'c'.
	 builder.WriteRune('a')
	 builder.WriteRune('b')
	 builder.WriteRune('c')
	 
	 // YOUR CODE HERE: Call the "WriteString" method on
	 // "builder" once, with the string "defg".
	 builder.WriteString("defg")
	 
	 // YOUR CODE HERE: Call the "String" method on
	 // "builder", and pass the return value to
	 // "fmt.Println".
	 fmt.Println(builder.String())
