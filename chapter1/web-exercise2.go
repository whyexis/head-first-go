/**
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Code Rework
 * Several of the variable names used in this example break Go naming conventions.
 * The code is also somewhat longer than it needs to be.
 * See if you can modify so that itâ€™s shorter and follows conventions better, but still produces the same output.
 * Output = 503.7
