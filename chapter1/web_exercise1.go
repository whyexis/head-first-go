 * Fill in the Blanks
 * The program below should take a number of cans of food and calculate their total weight.
 * It should declare a count variable with the number of cans, and a unitWeight variable with the amount (in kilograms) that each can weighs.
 * It should then multiply count by unitWeight, and assign the result to a new totalWeight variable.
 * Finally, it should print the number of cans and their total weight.
 * Fill in the blanks in the program so that it will run and produce the specified output. Note that count will have a type of int, but unitWeight will have a type of float64, so youâ€™ll need to do a conversion before you can multiply the two together.
